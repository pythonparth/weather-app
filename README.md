# 🌦️ Animated Weather App

A **full‑stack weather application** built with **Node.js (Express)** on the backend and **React + Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion** on the frontend.  
It fetches live forecast data from the [National Weather Service API](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api) and displays it with **smooth background animations** that change based on the weather conditions.
